# Exercise 3: String Operations

## Objective
This program allows the user to perform several operations on a string, such as displaying, reversing, and counting the number of words.

## Files
- `Application.java`: Presents a menu to the user and handles input.
- `StringEditor.java`: Implements the operations on the string.

## Functionalities
- **Input and Display**: The string is read using `Scanner`, and displayed if not empty.
- **Reversing the String**: The `reverse()` function splits the string into words, reverses their order, and joins them back.
- **Counting Words**: The `countWords()` function removes extra spaces and counts the number of words.

## Usage
1. Run `Application.java`.
2. Choose an operation from the menu: input a string, display, reverse, or count words.
3. After each operation, you can return to the menu for more actions.
