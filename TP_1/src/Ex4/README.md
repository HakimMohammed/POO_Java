# Exercise 4: Character Occurrence Counter

## Objective
This program reads a string from the user and counts the occurrences of each letter of the alphabet (case insensitive).

## Files
- `Application.java`: Handles user input.
- `CharCalculator.java`: Implements the logic for counting character occurrences.

## Functionalities
- **Character Counting**: The `runCalculator()` function converts the string to lowercase, removes spaces, and counts occurrences of each letter using an array of size 26, where each index represents a letter of the alphabet.

## Usage
1. Run `Application.java`.
2. Input a string of text.
3. The program will display how many times each letter appears in the string.
