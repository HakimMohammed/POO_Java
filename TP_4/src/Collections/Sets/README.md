# `Collections.Sets`'s Documentation

## Class `Main`

### Description
The `Main` class demonstrates the use of `HashSet` to manage groups of students and perform operations such as finding intersections and unions between two sets.

### Methods

#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Description**: Entry point for the application. Demonstrates the following functionalities:
    1. **Creating two `HashSet` groups**: `groupeA` and `groupeB`.
    2. **Adding students** to each group.
    3. **Finding the intersection** of students present in both groups.
    4. **Finding the union** of all students from both groups.
- **Behavior**:
    - Initializes two `HashSet` objects to represent groups of students.
    - Adds specific students to each group.
    - Compares the two groups to identify common students (intersection).
    - Combines the two groups into a single set containing all students (union).
